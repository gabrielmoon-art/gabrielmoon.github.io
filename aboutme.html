<h1>about me</h1>
<div class="divider"></div>
<h3>my name is gabriel moon, and i was born on february 14, 2008 in florence, south carolina. i've had an interest in music since i was about 8 years old, which was when i started to create it, although i never started to get serious with it until early 2023, where i discovered radiohead. their song 'no surprises' became my favorite song of all time almost immediately and it changed my entire perspective of music, leading me to actively seek out more music. the music i made following that was horrible though 😭. i began playing guitar in june of that year, but gave up rather quickly, and picked it back up in september 2024. i also own an electric keyboard, glockenspiel, kalimba, tambourine, and shakers. </h3>
<h3>my music mainly consists of alternative rock, shoegaze, noise rock, dream pop, and grunge. if you like any of those, stick around! throughout the time i make music, i wish to cover as much genres as i can. further down the line i plan to create more indietronica or other music of rock-adjacent genres. </h3>
<div class="divider"></div>
<h3>my hobbies include: seeking out new music, drawing, watching tv series, cooking, a bit of gaming, writing, and playing my instruments</h3>
